    <h1 style="color:red;">Google queries are simple yet powerful</h1>
    <p>To enter a query into Google, <strong><span style="color: green;" >just type in a few descriptive keywords and hit "search."</span></strong> That's it! If you need them, however, we also provide a few advanced search operators.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><span style="color: red;">NEW!</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:green;">The "" operator. </span></strong>Google automatically prefers pages where the query terms are found in close proximity. However, sometimes the only relevant pages are those where some or all of the query words occur as a phrase. You can enclose words in double-quotes ("like this") to force the words to appear together in all returned documents.</li>
        <li> <strong><span style="color: red;">NEW!</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:green;">The - operator.</span></strong> Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search. That is, you want all relevant result pages except those containing a certain word. We support this "not" functionality with the "-" operator. Simply prefix your query word with a - (-like -this) to make Google ignore all pages containing that word.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="color: green;">Automatic AND.</span></strong> Google only supports "and" queries. That is, it only returns pages that include all the query terms. The + operator, which enforces "and" behavior on some search engines, is unnecessary on Google (though it can be used to include stopwords; see below).</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="color:red;">Do more than query</h1>
    <p>The results of a Google search do a lot to help point you toward the right result: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990423185917if_/http://www.google.com/legend.html">numbers in the results</a> help you figure out result quality, and the query word-sensitive content helps you figure out what the pages are about.</p>
    <p>The results can also be used for further exploration of the web. Click on the bar graph at the beginning of the result, and see <span style="color: green;" >what pages link to this page.</span></p>
    <p>Click on the "cached" link, and see what the page looked like when we indexed it. Has the page changed so much it doesn't hold the information you need anymore? Perhaps the version in the cache will be more helpful.</p>
    <h1 style="color:red;">Feeling lucky?</h1>
    <p>The "I feel lucky" button automatically takes you to the first web page returned for your query. When it works -- and it often works -- it means less time searching for web pages and more time looking at them.</p>
    <h1 style="color:red;">Limitations on queries</h1>
    Google does not support all of the operations found in all search engines. Many of these we plan on supporting in a future release.
